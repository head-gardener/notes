* Terraform
  Terraform is an open-source client-only declarative IaC tool.

** Design
   Terraform uses a DSL called HCL. It's declarative, deploying Terraform configurations is idempotent. When deploying configurations, Terraform builds out a dependency graph, which determines the order, in which resources are deployed to the provider.

** Tools
   - `terraform` cli
   -- `plan` prints out necessary changes to the env.
   -- `graph` outputs resources in DOT language.
