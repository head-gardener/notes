* Tips
** Reading secrets
   To read a secret value to an env var without writing it to disk explicitly,
   use:
   @code sh
   read -sx SECRET
   @end

   Don't forget to erase once you are done!
   @code sh
   read -e SECRET
   @end

* Integrations
** carapace
   Works, but built-in completions are way better.
