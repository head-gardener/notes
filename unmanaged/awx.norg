* Overview
  Like Tower?
  I think it would be nice as a control panel and a runner.

* Installation
  Needs a postgres. Normally distributed as an operator, which seems weird for a
  single-container application - I need to look into it. Alternatives include a
  container image and a chart. Interestingly enough, on github it's never
  mentioned in any nix projects - probably because there is no binary, it's just
  a django-style `manage.py` project.
