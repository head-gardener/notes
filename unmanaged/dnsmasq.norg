DNS, DHCP, TFTP in a simple package.

DNS configuration gets read from host, namely `/etc/hosts` for hosts and
`/etc/resolv/conf` for other stuff. You can overwrite locations of both these files and
add more hosts (`addn-hosts`).

For shorter names there are `expand-hosts` and `domain` options, which add a domain to the
end of every host (e.g. 'my-computer.lan'). These are complimented by `search <domain>` in
`resolvconf`, allowing you to use short names while being precise.
