* DNS Cache
  Exists for caching DNS requests, normally stored by the client (e.g. a browser). In
  Chrome can be accessed via [chrome://net-internals/#dns].

* DNS Resolution
  Performed via `gethostbyname` function call, which varies by OS. The function first
  checks the `hosts` file (on Linux it's `/etc/hosts`). When absent in the file and cache,
  a host is checked against a nearest DNS, which is normally a local router.
