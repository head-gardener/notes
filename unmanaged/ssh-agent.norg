* Configuration
  `services.ssh-agent` for hm, `programs.ssh.startAgent` for nixos.
  Both have some other fun stuff in `programs.ssh` that I haven't really figured out yet.
  Also the config is complete bullshit, more on that in {./hm-vs-nixos.html}[hm-vs-nixos].

* Usage
** ssh-add
   `ssh-add <id>` to add an identity, other flags control the storage. 
   `ssh-agent -t 1h` might be good, but that depends on my chosen workflow. Also hm doesn't have this, might want to patch it in.
