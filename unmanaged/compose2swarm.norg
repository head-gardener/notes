* Overview
  Migration from compose to single-node swarm gives you access to raft run by
  docker, which enables you to store secrets and configs on the daemon - without
  consul or vault. Early swarm adoption also enables you to migrate to multiple
  nodes futher down the line.

* Caveats
** `docker compose run`
** `docker compose exec`
** secret/config immutability
