** TODO
   - (x) get info about restart location from env
   - (x) scratchpad via workspaces
   - (x) minimizing firefox leads to `Prelude.chr: bad argument: (-30)` and a freeze
         window props most likely to blame
   - ( ) cpanel doesn't work
   - ( ) redo volup/down logic to use either pw api, dbus or whatever for displaying
         volume level in notifs (or no notifs and volume on bar).
