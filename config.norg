** (x) figure out the done thing
   The issue was with the script checking for kitty first, before reaching the tmux clause. Simple sed substitution can fix it right away, but need to watch for future changes to the codebase!
   Though I still wonder why this isn't an issue with non-tmux windows, huh.
** ( ) Linux 6.5.7
   Backported to 23.11 recently. Might wanna check out!
** (-) substitute-* backport?
   Cool feature. Might be backported, might be in 24.05. Time will show.
   Once it drops, grep all usages and replace stdenv to normal from unstable.
