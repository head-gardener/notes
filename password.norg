* Entropy
  For character streams with 0 autocorrelation binary entropy is `<string_length>*log2(<character_set_size>)`. You can check it with the `ent` command.
  Binary entropy of `128` is considered enough in the current climate. Notice that doubling the character set's size only raises the entropy by 1. E.g. `base64` with all uppercase characters converted to lowercase (around 38 characters) gives around `5.2` bits compared to `6` bits of pure `base64`.

* Cookbook
  You can generate fairly secure (6 bits per character, 22 characters to 128 bits) passwords with `cat /dev/urandom | head -c "$argv" | base64 | tr + = | tr '\n' -d`.
